# yaig

Yet another index generator

## Getting started

This project requires Go to be installed. On OS X with Homebrew you can just run `brew install go`.

Running it then should be as simple as:

```console
$ make
$ ./bin/yaig
```

## Usage

Yaig creates an (inverted index)[https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/invertedIndex.html] for a given `"*.txt"` input

## Example

Given a sample input:
The Road Not Taken 
BY ROBERT FROST
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.
